And one of the most important ways to communicate with your team is through commit messages. A good commit message should be clear, concise, and informative. It should describe what changes were made and why they were made. However, writing good commit messages can be time-consuming and tedious. That’s where GitHub Copilot comes in. GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code completion tool that can help you write code faster and more efficiently. But did you know that GitHub Copilot can also help you write better commit messages? In this post, we’ll show you how to use GitHub Copilot to generate commit messages automatically.</p> <h2 id="step-1-add-github-copilot-template-to-your-repository">Step 1: Add GitHub Copilot template to your repository</h2> <p>To get started, you need to add a GitHub Copilot template to your repository. This template will provide GitHub Copilot with the necessary context to generate commit messages. You can create a new file in your repository called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.github/git-commit-instructions.md</code> and add the following content:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Git Commit Instructions

When making a commit, please follow these guidelines to ensure clarity and consistency in our commit history.
Provide description in the commit message.
* Describe the changes made in the commit and intended impact on the codebase in new lines.
* Make sure to include:
    * What was changed (e.g., added feature, fixed bug, updated documentation).
    * Why the change was necessary (e.g., to improve performance, fix an issue, enhance user experience).
    * Any relevant details that help understand the context of the change.
* Elaborate on the reasoning behind the changes and any relevant context that may help reviewers understand the
commit better.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This template provides guidelines for writing good commit messages and will help GitHub Copilot generate better commit messages.</p> <h2 id="step-2-use-github-copilot-to-generate-commit-messages">Step 2: Use GitHub Copilot to generate commit messages</h2> <p>Once you have added the template to your repository, you can start using GitHub Copilot to generate commit messages. When you are ready to make a commit, you can use one of the following IDE editors that support GitHub Copilot:</p> <ul> <li>Visual Studio Code</li> <li>JetBrains IDEs (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm)</li> <li>Neovim</li> </ul> <p>When you click the commit message editor button, GitHub Copilot will suggest a commit message based on the changes you have made and the guidelines provided in the template. GitHub Copilot will automatically suggest a commit message based on the changes you have made and the guidelines provided in the template.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>Using GitHub Copilot to generate commit messages automatically can help you write better commit messages and improve your productivity. By adding a GitHub Copilot template to your repository and using one of the supported IDE editors that support GitHub Copilot, you can easily generate clear and informative commit messages.

Is it some secret tradition? Or maybe a way to fight boredom? The answer is more technical, but there’s a bit of history and… a touch of absurdity! 😄</p> <h2 id="technical-reasons-️">Technical reasons 🛠️</h2> <h3 id="1-posix-standard-">1. <strong>POSIX Standard</strong> 🧑‍💻</h3> <p>Imagine POSIX as a strict teacher in the school of programmers. It says: “Every text file must end with a new line (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\n</code>). End of discussion!” Why? Because tools like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cat</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">diff</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git</code> love order. If a file doesn’t end with a new line, they might get upset and show weird results, e.g., merging the last line of one file with the first of another. It’s like two sentences in a book blending into one – chaos! 📚</p> <p>POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) was created to unify the behavior of operating systems. Thanks to this, programs can work predictably on different computers. And the empty line at the end of a file is a small gesture towards order and compatibility. ✨</p> <h3 id="2-avoiding-errors-in-php-">2. <strong>Avoiding errors in PHP</strong> 🐘</h3> <p>In PHP, if anything appears after the closing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?&gt;</code> tag – even an innocent space or new line – the server might get angry and send HTTP headers at the wrong moment. The result? The page looks weird, and you spend half a day looking for the bug. The empty line is like a programmer’s lucky charm! 🍀</p> <h3 id="3-better-readability-">3. <strong>Better readability</strong> 👀</h3> <p>An empty line at the end of a file is like a period at the end of a sentence. Thanks to it, the code looks neat, and changes in version control systems are clearer. Git likes it when everything is in its place! 😎</p> <h3 id="4-psr-2-and-psr-12-standards-">4. <strong>PSR-2 and PSR-12 Standards</strong> 📏</h3> <p>And what does PHP-FIG, the programmers’ council of elders, say? They invented the PSR-2 standard, and then its younger, more demanding brother PSR-12. Both clearly state: there must be a new line at the end of the file! This way, your code complies with the guidelines, and your linter doesn’t have a panic attack. It’s a bit like following health and safety rules in code – nobody wants to get a ticket from the reviewer! 🚨</p> <h2 id="historical-reasons-">Historical reasons 🏺</h2> <p>In the past, text editors were moody. The lack of an empty line could cause errors during compilation or code interpretation. So developers learned to add this magic line to avoid surprises. It’s a bit like wearing socks with sandals – not always needed and considered a fashion crime, but sometimes it saves the day! 🧦</p> <h2 id="twig-️">Twig 🕸️</h2> <p>In Twig files, the empty line helps avoid unwanted characters in the generated HTML. Thanks to this, your page doesn’t look like a patchwork of random spaces and enters. And version control systems? They’re grateful too! 🙏</p> <h2 id="summary-">Summary 🎉</h2> <p>Adding an empty line at the end of PHP and Twig files is not just a technical necessity, but also a part of programming culture. It protects against errors, keeps things tidy, and makes tools happy. So next time you add an empty line, you can feel like a code hero! 🦸‍♂️</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="php"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This post explains why developers add an empty line at the end of PHP and Twig files, presenting technical, historical, and humorous reasons for this practice.

Symfony Flex is a Composer plugin that helps manage Symfony applications by automating the installation and configuration of packages. When you install a package that has a recipe, Symfony Flex adds configuration files and settings to your project automatically. You may prefer to remove some of these recipes if they are no longer needed or if you want to customize your setup. In my case it was docker setup that I didn’t need.</p> <div class="language-json highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">

This time, I decided to take a closer look at the array declaration function and what really lies behind it. From what I remember, using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">array()</code> was considered outdated by my colleagues at work and should no longer be used. To verify this, I decided to pull the repository of a PHP code refactoring and updating framework—Rector. After all, what tool is better at handling arrays than one designed for refactoring and adhering to best coding practices?</p> <h2 id="a-deep-dive-into-the-shallow-end">A Deep Dive into the Shallow End</h2> <p>To my surprise, I didn’t find many examples. In fact, the only example where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">array()</code> was actually used—or rather its documentation, recommending against its use—was in Rector’s framework under the golden rule for <a href="https://github.com/rectorphp/rector/blob/59ca5ad3cdd75183ef65f6929693903f2f2a1717/rules/Php54/Rector/Array_/LongArrayToShortArrayRector.php#L30">LongArrayToShortArray</a>:</p> <div class="language-php highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="n">getRuleDefinition</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">RuleDefinition</span>

In <strong>PHP 5.4</strong>, the short array syntax was introduced. Since then, it has been recommended to use the shorter array notation.</p> <p>However, this still doesn’t fully answer the question: What is the fundamental difference between calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">array()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[]</code>? So what really happens behind the scenes? When executing a PHP script, you first need to bake a cake… To bake a cake, you need to:</p> <figure> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oVSGrY4DfUg" class="rounded z-depth-1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe> </figure> <h2 id="creating-an-abstract-syntax-tree--the-cake">Creating an Abstract Syntax Tree – The Cake</h2> <p>The key is understanding AST (Abstract Syntax Tree). This is a tree structure necessary to separate the compilation process from the parser. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis">Lexer</a> returns tokens, which are then processed by the parser to generate the AST structure. This structure is then compiled into opcode, stored in opcache, and later interpreted by the computer as executable instructions. To learn more about this topic, I recommend watching the following video:</p> <blockquote> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWITYIWyowk">Climbing the Abstract Syntax Tree - James Titcumb - Forum PHP 2017</a></p> </blockquote> <h2 id="so-where-exactly-is-the-difference-between--and-array">So, Where Exactly is the Difference Between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[]</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">array()</code>?</h2> <p>The first difference I noticed was in the <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/Zend/zend_compile.h#L1044">compiler</a>:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>#define ZEND_ARRAY_SYNTAX_LIST 1  /* list() */

This requires more work during tokenization and parsing compared to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">array()</code>, where the lexer directly returns a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T_ARRAY</code> token, and the parser simply processes it as a single expression.</li> <li>In a PHP version without opcache, code must be processed every time it is executed, meaning that both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">array()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[]</code> must go through the lexer and parser to generate AST and opcodes.</li> <li>Longer parsing time for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[]</code>: Since <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[]</code> requires additional analysis by the parser (to recognize brackets), processing takes longer.</li> <li>Shorter parsing time for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">array()</code>: The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T_ARRAY</code> token is easier to recognize, and the parser does not have to perform additional syntax analysis.</li> </ul> <p>Who would have thought that to determine the real difference between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[]</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">array()</code>, I would have to delve so deeply into PHP?

Nothing like a solid cheat sheet before an interview! This series is fueled by the fact that PHP has been going through some serious changes lately—new versions have stirred things up quite a bit. Time to refresh that knowledge, take some proper notes, and—let’s be honest—catch up before getting left behind!</p> <h2 id="examples-straight-from-the-repo">Examples Straight from the Repo</h2> <p>Just hearing “array functions” makes people uneasy. The internet is flooded with examples, some good, some… let’s just say <em>questionable</em>.<br/> Every junior dev knows how to <em>use</em> these functions, so I decided to dig deeper and see how they’re actually applied in some well-known PHP frameworks I’ve worked with:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://github.com/symfony/symfony">Symfony</a> – The most <em>business-mature</em> platform in terms of compatibility and use cases. Gotta be some gems in there.</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/laravel/laravel">Laravel</a> – Unlike Symfony, this one moves fast, with major changes between versions. But hey, that also means it’s a great place to find some spicy array function tricks.</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/rectorphp/rector">Rector</a> – My go-to tool for modernizing old PHP code. I bet it’s packed with good examples of array functions in action.</li> </ul> <hr/> <h2 id="example-with-array_filter">Example with array_filter</h2> <p>I set sail on the vast ocean of PHP code and—ironically—ran straight into an iceberg. The first class I bumped into was <a href="https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/7.2/src/Symfony/Bridge/Doctrine/ArgumentResolver/EntityValueResolver.php">EntityValueResolver</a>, which implements the <a href="https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/7.3/src/Symfony/Component/HttpKernel/Controller/ValueResolverInterface.php">ValueResolverInterface</a>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EntityValueResolver</code> is responsible for automatically passing entities to a controller based on an ID from the URL. For example, this tiny piece of code:</p> <div class="language-php highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">#[Route('/user/{id}', name: 'user_show')]</span>
<span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="n">show</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">User</span> <span class="nv">$user</span><span class="p">):</span> <span class="kt">Response</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">Response</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'User: '</span> <span class="mf">.</span> <span class="nv">$user</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="nf">getUsername</span><span class="p">());</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Here, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">User</code> is a mapped database entity, automatically hydrated and returned from the database. More on that here. Neat feature, right? But let’s get back to the juicy part—array functions. Meet <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.array-filter.php">array_filter</a>, found in <a href="https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/7.2/src/Symfony/Bridge/Doctrine/ArgumentResolver/EntityValueResolver.php#L178">EntityValueResolver</a></p> <div class="language-php highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$options</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">stripNull</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nv">$criteria</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">array_filter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$criteria</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">static</span> <span class="k">fn</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$value</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kc">null</span> <span class="o">!==</span> <span class="nv">$value</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The array_filter function takes an array and a <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.closure.php">Closure</a> (a.k.a. an <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.anonymous.php">anonymous function</a>), which returns <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">false</code> for each element. Now, the spicy part: the function is used as static. According to the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.anonymous.php#functions.anonymous-functions.static">docs</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Anonymous functions may be declared statically. This prevents them from having the current class automatically bound to them. Objects may also not be bound to them at runtime.</p> </blockquote> <p>So, this blocks the use of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">bindTo</a> method. But why would anyone want to do that? Possible reasons:</p> <p>a) To prevent accidental access to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$this</code> within a class context.</p> <p>b) To improve performance and avoid potential memory leaks.</p> <p>c) To stop an anonymous function from being later assigned to another object and modifying its state dynamically.</p> <p>Option <strong>a)</strong> is key here. Declaring an anonymous function as <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.static.php">static</a> prevents it from being tied to a class instance, avoiding unintended access to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$this</code>. It’s also a nod to functional programming principles—keeping <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">functions pure</a> and avoiding side effects. While not mandatory, marking it as static makes the intent clear:</p> <blockquote> <p>This function has nothing to do with the class instance.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="example-with-array_merge">Example with array_merge</h2> <p>Function <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.array-merge.php">array_merge</a> merges two arrays, appending elements from the second one to the end of the first. <a href="https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/7.2/src/Symfony/Bridge/Doctrine/ArgumentResolver/EntityValueResolver.php#L223">Example</a> found in <a href="https://symfony.com">Symfony</a></p> <div class="language-php highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$repository</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$manager</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="nf">getRepository</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$options</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">class</span><span class="p">);</span>

However, we can take advantage of existing solutions. One such solution is <a href="https://github.com/bitwes/Gut">GUT</a>, which stands for Godot Unit Tests.</p> <h2 id="problem-definition">Problem Definition</h2> <p>Recently, I encountered the following issue in my project. I wanted to test error handling in my game when loading a saved game state.</p> <div class="language-py highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">## Reads the data from file and returns as a dictionary

<span class="bp">...</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>I first looked into the documentation for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileAccess.get_open_error</code>. This method returns an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">enum</code> type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Error</code>. Checking the returned code was a good lead, but first, I needed to write a test:</p> <div class="language-py highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">func</span> <span class="nf">test_load_if_game_save_doesnt_exist</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">void</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">var</span> <span class="n">save</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">GameSave</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">TestingGameSave.save</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">12345</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">var</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Dictionary</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">save</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">load_data</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="nf">assert_not_null</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This is a good starting point. I first check if there’s something to work with and whether the data is not null.<br/> I had a few ideas on how it should look. Mainly:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Don’t return errors</strong><br/> I didn’t want to throw exceptions and handle them outside the function. Instead, I aimed to handle errors where they occur.<br/> In GDScript, you cannot use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">try-catch</code> or throw exceptions, which is also not a good practice. I don’t like shifting responsibility onto others. I prefer solving problems where they actually occur, as that is the most likely place to resolve them effectively.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Avoid returning null values</strong><br/> This is a common issue that I call “null propagation.” The problem is that every time we return null, a small part of our humanity dies. And with every subsequent function call, we must first check whether the object is null before calling a method on it—otherwise, we risk a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NullPointerException</code>, which may crash the game mid-session.<br/> So, we must eliminate null values! This issue is discussed in more detail <a href="https://hackernoon.com/null-the-billion-dollar-mistake-8t5z32d6">here</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Don’t lump everything together</strong><br/> Returning errors or objects could trigger an avalanche of error handling (see point 1). The simpler, the better—this makes it easier to work with in the future.</p> </li> </ol> <h2 id="solution">Solution</h2> <p>I implemented the following code:</p> <div class="language-py highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">## Reads the data from file and returns as a dictionary

        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">data</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This looks pretty good, but I was still not satisfied.<br/> I wanted to test a scenario where an error occurs while ensuring that nothing gets printed to the console during the test execution—only when the problem actually arises. Additionally, I needed to handle the error code returned by Godot.<br/> All these factors combined posed a challenge, especially for a relatively young scripting language like GDScript.<br/> Here’s what I did:</p> <ul> <li>I used the <a href="https://gut.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Stubbing.html#to-call-callable">stub method from GUT</a>.</li> <li>Unfortunately, it’s not possible to override the built-in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">push_error</code> function. So, I wrote my own <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">print_error</code> method and called the original function inside it. Then, I replaced it with an anonymous function that set a flag to check whether the method was called correctly.</li> <li>Ideally, GUT’s <a href="https://gut.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Stubbing.html#to-call-callable">stub</a> would allow checking whether a method was actually invoked. For now, I had to rely on a global variable.</li> <li>Additionally, I had to use a <a href="https://gut.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Partial-Doubles.html">partial double</a> because stubbing methods on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">double</code> class objects requires it.</li> <li>I searched through the GUT documentation and found a way to verify this using the following function, provided that the checking class is a subclass of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stub</code>: <div class="language-py highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nf">assert_called</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">save</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">print_error</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="p">)</span>
