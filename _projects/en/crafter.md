# Project Description

This is a game concept that was created as part of a recruitment process for a Unity programmer position. Unfortunately, I didn't land the job, but I decided not to give up and to leverage the added value that this project brought. The main task was to implement an extensible item crafting system that would allow for the creation of item recipes and the gathering and discarding of items from the inventory through a crafting panel. In the project, I focused mainly on the code and the appropriate programming structure that would allow for building an item database in an accessible way for non-technical users.
