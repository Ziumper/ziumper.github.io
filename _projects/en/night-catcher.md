# Project Description

A simple Android game where you catch dots in a beautiful graphical setting with cute cats in the background. As the levels progress, the difficulty level increases, and subsequent levels become increasingly challenging. In this project, I was responsible for code reviews and the integration of the WWise tool for sound implementation. Additionally, I served in a supervisory and mentoring role, proposing appropriate technical solutions and code architecture.

## Features

The project implemented the following features:

- Beautiful graphics, 2D animations, and an intuitive user interface
- Dot-catching mechanics based on Unity's grid component
- Increasing difficulty levels with different backgrounds and transitions between levels
- Pleasant and catchy music
- Integration of Google ads
