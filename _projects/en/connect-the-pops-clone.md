# Project Description

This is a project completed as a recruitment task for a Unity programmer position. It's a logic game for Android, [Connect the pops!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.casox.ConnectToMerge), reminiscent of the rules of [2048](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)>). It includes the main game mechanics, which involve merging digital values in circular buttons with the value of the next power of the number 2.
