# Project Description

This project was created as part of the recruitment process for the company where I [worked](/cv). Its goal was to develop an IT system for file management. The system would be secure, with user authentication. Once logged in, users would be able to manage their files, reset passwords, and share files externally. This project secured my employment, so I've included it hereâ€”it may serve me well again in the future.

## Technologies and Tools Used

During the project, I familiarized myself with the following technologies and tools:

- Entity Framework Core
- Angular
- C#
- .NET Core
- MVC
- Visual Studio
- AutoMapper
- Bootstrap
- HTML
- TypeScript
- SCSS
- ASP.NET
- Rest
