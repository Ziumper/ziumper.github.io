As part of my work on the **Garage Flipper** project, I was responsible for key improvements to game mechanics and bug fixes, contributing to an enhanced user experience. My main tasks included:

- Refactoring code to improve its readability, performance, and maintainability.
- Implementing and optimizing the furniture arrangement system to provide intuitive and seamless space management in the game.
- Improving mission management by fixing logical errors and enhancing the system for assigning player objectives.
- Enhancing the user interface to make it more and functional.
- Utilizing the Flood Fill algorithm to detect and analyze rooms, which improved the game's spatial recognition capabilities.

This project was a valuable experience, allowing me to develop skills in debugging, system optimization, and team collaboration.
