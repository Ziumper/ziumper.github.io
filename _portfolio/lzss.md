# LZSS Compression Algorithm Implementation with Robust Search Using KMP

In the fast-paced world of data management, where both storage space and quick access to information are paramount, my project stands at the intersection of efficiency and reliability. It showcases the implementation of the LZSS (Lempel-Ziv-Storer-Szymanski) compression algorithm, which optimizes data storage, and incorporates the KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) algorithm for robust search capabilities.

# The Challenge

Efficient data compression is essential, but equally critical is the ability to retrieve information swiftly and reliably. The LZSS algorithm, renowned for its memory-saving prowess, forms the foundation of this project. However, to enhance its utility, I introduced the KMP algorithm, known for its robust string search capabilities.

# Leveraging KMP for Robust Search

The addition of the KMP algorithm enhances the LZSS compression algorithm's functionality. It provides a robust and efficient means of searching for patterns within compressed data. The KMP algorithm's advanced string matching techniques ensure accurate and rapid retrieval of information.

# Implementation Details

This project offers a comprehensive understanding of both the LZSS and KMP algorithms. It delves into the core principles of these algorithms, providing a detailed description of their operation and historical context.

# Coding, Decoding, and Searching in Harmony

Practicality is a core focus of this project. It not only showcases the encoding and decoding processes inherent to LZSS but also demonstrates the KMP algorithm's application in robust data retrieval. Pseudo code and source code listings enable users to explore the inner workings of both algorithms.

# Use Case Diagram and User Manual

To facilitate ease of use, a use case diagram outlines the algorithm's requirements and functionality, including its robust search capabilities. A user manual is also provided, offering step-by-step instructions on how to utilize the program effectively, showcasing the seamless integration of LZSS with KMP.

# Efficiency and Reliability in Data Management

With the incorporation of the KMP algorithm, this project aims to strike a balance between data compression efficiency and data retrieval reliability. It's a valuable asset for scenarios where both storage optimization and dependable data access are essential.
