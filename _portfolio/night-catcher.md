# Planning the Programming Structures

My journey with Night Catcher began with the intricate task of planning the game's programming structures. Crafting a scalable and efficient codebase was essential to support the game's growth and evolving features. We wanted Night Catcher to be more than just a casual clicker game; we aimed for a foundation that could accommodate future expansions and enhancements.

# Code Review and Quality Assurance

Maintaining the highest quality standards was paramount in our development process. As the lead programmer, I conducted thorough code reviews, collaborating closely with my colleagues to ensure clean, efficient, and bug-free code. This rigorous quality assurance process was instrumental in delivering a polished and reliable gaming experience.

# Integration of External Tools - Wwise and More

Night Catcher's charm extends beyond its visual elements. Sound plays a crucial role in creating the game's serene atmosphere. I led the integration of Wwise, a powerful audio tool, to enhance the auditory experience. From the gentle purring of cats to the ambient sounds of the night, every audio element was meticulously integrated to transport players into our enchanting world.

# Unit Tests and Reliability

To maintain the game's stability and reliability, we implemented a robust suite of unit tests. These tests were instrumental in identifying and rectifying potential issues, ensuring that Night Catcher would provide a seamless experience to players across various devices and platforms.

# Unity Engine Mastery

Night Catcher was brought to life using the Unity Engine, a versatile platform that allowed us to translate our creative vision into reality. Leveraging Unity's capabilities, we crafted a visually captivating and technically robust game that captivates players with its simplicity and charm.

# A Relaxing Escape with Adorable Cats

In Night Catcher, players can unwind and relax by interacting with a plethora of adorable cats, each with their own unique characteristics and levels.
