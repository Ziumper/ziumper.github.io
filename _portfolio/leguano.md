## Online store, based on shopware 6

It was my first shopware 6 project, where i was involved in to set up of environment for deployment and contributing of shopware plugin development and workflow. I created plugin for custom registration rules, which wasn't implemented directly in shopware 6 based installation. Durring development of project I learned about how important is team work and well suited workflow design.
