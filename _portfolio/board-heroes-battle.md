 I am excited to present my master's thesis project, a pioneering exploration into the realm of augmented reality (AR) gaming fused with turn-based strategy (TBS) mechanics on the Android platform. This thesis marks the culmination of extensive research and development efforts aimed at pushing the boundaries of immersive and strategic gameplay.

# The Research Objective

The primary objective of this thesis was to investigate the potential of augmenting traditional gaming experiences with AR technology, specifically within the context of TBS games. It sought to unravel how the integration of AR elements could enhance strategic depth and player engagement, leading to a more immersive and interactive gaming experience.

# Unity and Unreal Engine Unleashed

This research endeavor ventured into the utilization of two of the most powerful game development engines, Unity and Unreal Engine, to create two separate AR TBS gaming applications. Each engine brought its unique set of capabilities and aesthetics to the project, showcasing the versatility and adaptability of AR gaming.

# Technical Innovation

The implementation of this thesis project demanded a deep dive into AR development using Unity and Unreal Engine. Leveraging ARCore and ARKit in Unity and Unreal Engine's AR capabilities, I undertook the task of creating two stable, visually captivating, and technically sophisticated gaming experiences. This endeavor required meticulous attention to 3D model integration, real-time tracking, and rendering in both engines.

# Multiplayer and Solo Adventures

Both Unity and Unreal Engine versions of the AR game offer a range of gameplay modes to cater to diverse player preferences. Players can engage in thrilling multiplayer battles within the same LAN network. Alternatively, solo players can immerse themselves in captivating single-player adventures, tackling challenging AI opponents and uncovering the mysteries of the AR world.
