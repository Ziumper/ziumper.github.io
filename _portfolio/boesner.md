I had the privilege of taking the helm in the relaunch of the Boesner online store, an international e-commerce platform, powered by Shopware 5. This project was a testament to my skills in plugin development, my ability to work with legacy code, and my commitment to seeing a project through from start to finish.

# Plugin development experience

One of the key aspects of this project was the development of custom plugins to enhance the functionality of the online store. Leveraging my expertise in plugin development, I created tailored solutions that seamlessly integrated with Shopware 5. These plugins played a pivotal role in enhancing the user experience, streamlining checkout processes, and optimizing the overall performance of the online store.

# Working with legacy code

The Boesner online store had a rich history, which meant dealing with legacy code. I embraced the challenge of navigating and improving upon existing codebases. My role involved refactoring and modernizing legacy components to align them with contemporary coding standards. This process not only improved the store's performance but also made it more maintainable and adaptable for future updates.

# Project from Start to Finish

From the inception of the project to its successful relaunch, I was there every step of the way. I actively participated in project planning, scoping, and architecture design. Collaborating closely with cross-functional teams, I ensured that the development process remained efficient and agile.

Throughout the project, I meticulously crafted code, conducted rigorous testing, and addressed any issues that arose promptly. This dedication to detail and thoroughness resulted in a smooth project delivery.

The modernized platform not only maintained its loyal customer base but also attracted new users from around the world. The improved user interface, responsive design, and enhanced performance significantly boosted online sales and customer satisfaction.
