It's a web shop based on shopware 5, where many plugins have been implemented by me and my colegues from Sunzinet in E-commerce developers team. I think it the biggest challenge was to meet with sophisticated architecture of project and custom customer needs. I learned a lot durring work with this project not only in case of how to develop new exciting things but as well how i can work with and maintain such solutions. To read more about the project please go to links bellow, and check the shop yourself too!
