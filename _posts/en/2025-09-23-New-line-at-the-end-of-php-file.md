# Why do we add an empty line at the end of PHP and Twig files? 🤔

Have you ever wondered why developers stubbornly add an empty line at the end of files?
Is it some secret tradition? Or maybe a way to fight boredom? The answer is more technical, but there’s a bit of history and... a touch of absurdity! 😄

## Technical reasons 🛠️

### 1. **POSIX Standard** 🧑‍💻

Imagine POSIX as a strict teacher in the school of programmers.
It says: "Every text file must end with a new line (`\n`). End of discussion!" Why? Because tools like `cat`, `diff`, or `git` love order.
If a file doesn’t end with a new line, they might get upset and show weird results, e.g., merging the last line of one file with the first of another.
It’s like two sentences in a book blending into one – chaos! 📚

POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) was created to unify the behavior of operating systems.
Thanks to this, programs can work predictably on different computers. And the empty line at the end of a file is a small gesture towards order and compatibility. ✨

### 2. **Avoiding errors in PHP** 🐘

In PHP, if anything appears after the closing `?>` tag – even an innocent space or new line – the server might get angry and send HTTP headers at the wrong moment.
The result? The page looks weird, and you spend half a day looking for the bug. The empty line is like a programmer’s lucky charm! 🍀

### 3. **Better readability** 👀

An empty line at the end of a file is like a period at the end of a sentence. Thanks to it, the code looks neat, and changes in version control systems are clearer.
Git likes it when everything is in its place! 😎

### 4. **PSR-2 and PSR-12 Standards** 📏

And what does PHP-FIG, the programmers’ council of elders, say? They invented the PSR-2 standard, and then its younger, more demanding brother PSR-12.
Both clearly state: there must be a new line at the end of the file! This way, your code complies with the guidelines, and your linter doesn’t have a panic attack.
It’s a bit like following health and safety rules in code – nobody wants to get a ticket from the reviewer! 🚨

## Historical reasons 🏺

In the past, text editors were moody. The lack of an empty line could cause errors during compilation or code interpretation.
So developers learned to add this magic line to avoid surprises.
It’s a bit like wearing socks with sandals – not always needed and considered a fashion crime, but sometimes it saves the day! 🧦

## Twig 🕸️

In Twig files, the empty line helps avoid unwanted characters in the generated HTML. Thanks to this, your page doesn’t look like a patchwork of random spaces and enters. And version control systems? They’re grateful too! 🙏

## Summary 🎉

Adding an empty line at the end of PHP and Twig files is not just a technical necessity,
but also a part of programming culture. It protects against errors, keeps things tidy, and makes tools happy.
So next time you add an empty line, you can feel like a code hero! 🦸‍♂️
