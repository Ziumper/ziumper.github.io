This post will be a bit longer because I want to present the pains and the journey this IDE has gone through from old software to its newer version. I also want to focus on the drawbacks and, in a sense, show what working in Apache NetBeans looks like today. When did I come across it? Why did I start using it only recently, and why does it seem that this IDE is coming back into favor? I will also try to present how to configure the IDE and my first impressions.

## Why not PHPStorm?

It's not that PHPStorm is bad. It's very good! You could even say it's too good. What I like in software is the feeling that I have control over what I'm doing. On a daily basis, developer tools can be a bit overwhelming. I include the following elements:

- high resource consumption
- the number of plugins and configuration options
- multitude of functionalities

Before I even started a project, I had already disabled unnecessary plugins five times and restarted my laptop.

In NetBeans, I just opened the project and started coding. It also offers most of the features I need, without significantly affecting my work efficiency.

## The long road of Apache NetBeans

I remember back in college there was a program for Java – NetBeans. It was one of the first free and open-source editors that allowed comfortable work with Java projects. Over time, NetBeans came under the wing of the Apache Foundation, which gave it a second life. Today, NetBeans is not just Java – it supports PHP, JavaScript, HTML, C/C++, and many other technologies.

For years, NetBeans was somewhat forgotten, especially in the PHP community, where PHPStorm, Visual Studio Code, or Sublime Text dominated. However, the latest versions of NetBeans have brought many improvements that make it worth giving it a try.

## Configuring Apache NetBeans

Configuring NetBeans is relatively simple, although it requires a few steps:

1. **Installation** – NetBeans can be downloaded directly from the Apache website. The installer is available for all popular operating systems.
2. **Plugins** – After installation, it's worth browsing the available plugins. NetBeans natively supports PHP, but you can add support for other languages.
3. **PHP Configuration** – In the settings, you need to specify the path to the PHP interpreter and configure tools such as Composer, PHPUnit, or PHP_CodeSniffer.
4. **GIT Integration** – NetBeans has built-in GIT support, allowing convenient work with repositories directly from the IDE.
5. **Personalization** – The ability to customize themes, keyboard shortcuts, and window layouts.

## Advantages of Apache NetBeans

- **Lightweight** – NetBeans is noticeably less resource-intensive than PHPStorm. It runs smoothly even on older computers.
- **Open Source** – Completely free, with no license restrictions.
- **Support for many languages** – Besides PHP, it works great with Java, JavaScript, HTML, C/C++.
- **Built-in tools** – Debugger, profiler, GIT integration, support for frameworks (e.g., Symfony, Laravel).
- **Stability** – Rarely crashes, and updates are regular.
- **Simple configuration** – You can start working quickly without installing dozens of extensions.

## Disadvantages of Apache NetBeans

- **Autocomplete** – Works well but requires using PHPDoc. In PHPStorm, suggestions are more advanced and do not require such detailed documentation.
- **Fewer plugins** – The NetBeans community is smaller than, for example, VSCode, so the number of available extensions is limited.
- **Appearance** – The user interface is somewhat outdated compared to the competition.
- **No native Docker integration** – You have to configure the environment manually, which can be inconvenient when working with containers.
- **Static code analysis** – Works, but is not as extensive as in PHPStorm.
- **Fewer educational materials** – It's harder to find up-to-date tutorials and community support.

## Example use cases

NetBeans works great in small and medium PHP projects where you don't need advanced refactoring tools or cloud integration. It's ideal for people who value simplicity and stability while still wanting access to basic IDE features.

## FAQ – Frequently Asked Questions

**Is NetBeans suitable for large projects?**

It is, although in very large projects it may be less efficient than PHPStorm. However, for most use cases, it is sufficient.

**Does NetBeans support PHP frameworks?**

Yes, it supports popular frameworks like Symfony, Laravel, Zend. However, this sometimes requires manual configuration.

**How is the support for unit testing?**

NetBeans allows integration with PHPUnit, and you can run tests directly from the IDE.

**Can you use NetBeans on Linux/Mac/Windows?**

Yes, NetBeans is cross-platform.

**Does NetBeans support modern PHP standards?**

Yes, it supports PHP 8.x, typing, and static code analysis tools.

**How is the support for JavaScript and frontend?**

NetBeans supports JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and frontend frameworks, although not as well as VSCode.

## Tips and tricks

- It's worth using the "Live Templates" feature for quickly inserting repetitive code snippets.
- You can configure your own keyboard shortcuts, which significantly speeds up work.
- NetBeans allows quick switching between files and classes (Ctrl+O, Ctrl+Shift+O).
- It's worth regularly updating the IDE and plugins – this improves stability and security.
- If you work with Docker, you will probably need to configure the environment manually.

## My experience and recommendations

After several months of working with NetBeans, I can say that it is a tool that lets you focus on code. It doesn't distract with an excess of options, yet provides everything needed for daily work. If you're looking for an alternative to heavy, paid IDEs – it's worth trying NetBeans. I especially recommend it to those who value simplicity, stability, and open source.
