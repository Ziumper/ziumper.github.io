## What is n8n?

n8n is a process automation tool, with a particular focus on AI-related automations.

Its key features include:

- has a community (open source) version. [Repository link](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n)
- written in TypeScript
- strongly resembles blueprint programming from Unreal Engine
- offers many ready-made nodes and integrations
- very easy to use (drag and drop)
- allows you to combine processes into sub-processes
- if you know [BPMN](https://www.bpmn.org/), you'll quickly understand how it works
- enables you to write code in the built-in editor using JavaScript and Python

## Working with n8n

One of the most important things I realized while working with n8n was how crucial it is to ensure the correct structure of input and output data. It provides options for collecting, aggregating, and filtering data. Data processing is inherently iterative.

Writing code is quite convenient â€“ there are suggestions and autocompletion. I had to adjust a bit and use JavaScript blocks to ensure proper hydration and data structure.

## What can you use it for?

I think it's great for:

- orchestration and automation of processes
- automating repetitive tasks
- quick integration of popular tools
- data synchronization

## Example use case

With n8n, I automated the process of fetching new entries from an RSS feed and saving them to Google Sheets. Thanks to the ready-made integrations, it was enough to connect a few nodes, set up a schedule, and everything works automatically.

## Drawbacks and limitations

During my tests, I noticed that:

- some integrations require additional configuration or API keys,
- the web interface can sometimes be less responsive with large workflows,
- the documentation is extensive, but not always detailed for less popular nodes.

## Summary

n8n is a great tool for people who want to quickly implement automations without writing a lot of code. I especially recommend it to those who value flexibility and the ability to expand their own workflows.
