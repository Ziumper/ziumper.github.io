Have you ever added a new argument to a function or constructor in PHP and forgotten to add a comma at the end of the previous line? It's a common mistake that can lead to unnecessary fixes and frustration.

Fortunately, since PHP 7.3 you can use the so-called trailing comma, i.e., a comma after the last argument in function calls, function declarations, and arrays. Thanks to this, when you add a new argument, you don't have to remember to manually add a comma at the end of the previous line.

### üõë Example without trailing comma

```php
class User {
    public function __construct(
        string $name,
        int $age
    ) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

If you want to add another argument, you have to go back to the previous line and add a comma:

```php
class User {
    public function __construct(
        string $name,
        int $age, // you have to add a comma
        string $email
    ) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

### ‚úÖ Example with trailing comma

```php
class User {
    public function __construct(
        string $name,
        int $age,
    ) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

Now you can simply add another argument without worrying about commas:

```php
class User {
    public function __construct(
        string $name,
        int $age,
        string $email,
    ) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

### üìÖ Since when?

Trailing comma in function and method argument lists is available since PHP 7.3. Previously, it was only available in arrays.

### üìù Summary

Using the trailing comma:

- makes adding and removing arguments easier,
- reduces the risk of syntax errors,
- improves code readability in the long run.

It's worth using this feature, especially in larger projects!
