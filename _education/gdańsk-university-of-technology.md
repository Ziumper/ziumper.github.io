Life as a commercial software developer was a dynamic and fulfilling journey, a journey that instilled in me the significance of innovation, efficiency, and problem-solving in the world of technology. However, with each passing project and every line of code written, I realized that my passion for software development was merely the beginning of a profound intellectual adventure.

In the ever-evolving realm of technology, I found myself drawn to a deeper understanding of software engineering and the intricate standards that underpin this dynamic field. The decision to further my education and embark on a path of continuous learning was born out of a desire to explore, experiment, and elevate my expertise beyond the confines of commercial development.

# Thesis topic

In the culmination of my educational journey, my master's thesis focused on a comprehensive comparison of Augmented Reality (AR) integration in two of the industry's leading game engines, Unity and Unreal Engine. This study involved the development of two distinct AR applications, each powered by one of these engines, and explored their capabilities in-depth, including the seamless implementation of multiplayer functionality.
