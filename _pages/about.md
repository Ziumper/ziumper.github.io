# Past Experience

My developer story started in the summer of 2017 after my successful graduation in computer science. Since that, I am always looking for an opportunity to grow my skills. Software development is a way to create with only imagination as a border, so I started a company to bring my skills to a new level. I hope we can work together on new exciting things.
