Hi, my name is Tomek!

I am a programmer and IT consultant with a broad range of skills. Throughout my career in various positions, I have gained valuable IT skills and knowledge that have allowed me to implement innovative ideas, mitigate emerging risks, and build scalable and resilient solutions. I always approach my work professionally, and combining it with passion helps me maintain a high level of motivation and a proactive attitude. I also place a strong emphasis on development, using the latest technologies in the IT industry while not forgetting about old, proven solutions.

I started my IT journey from an early age, continuing through years of education and work. If you want to know more about me and my career path, I encourage you to look through the [projects I have completed](/projects) and [my curriculum vitae](/cv). If I can help in any way, don't hesitate to [contact me](mailto:tomasz.komoszeski@gmail.com).

In my free time, I enjoy traveling, programming, and playing games, reading interesting books, and writing posts on [my blog](/blog)!
