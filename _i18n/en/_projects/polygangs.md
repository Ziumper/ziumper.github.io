# Project Description

The game focuses on recreating life in a Polish city in the 1990s. Conceptually, it resembles game series such as GTA or Driver. Gameplay revolves around the main character. Players focus on exploration and completing tasks, interacting with non-playable characters or other available in-game activities. As the storyline progresses, players discover the game world and the environment of a Polish city, characteristic car brands, fashion, and subcultures, all complemented by visually appealing low-poly graphics.

## Responsibilities

Within this project, I was responsible for:
- bug fixing
- designing and implementing new mechanics
- code reviews
- integrating and extending external add-ons that expand or add available mechanics
- writing unit tests
- implementing some special effects, animations, and sounds
- prototyping

## Knowledge gain

This was one of the first game titles I worked on in a fully commercial project in the game-dev industry. It taught me to maintain a distance from the code I was creating, consider the accessibility of new features when designing for non-technical people, make technological compromises, rapid prototyping, and testing effective solutions.
