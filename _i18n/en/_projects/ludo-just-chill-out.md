# Project Description

The project was based on the rules of the iconic board game Ludo, also known as Pachisi. Its goal is to move all of your pieces from the starting point to home, your square in the opposite corner of the board. Ludo is both an exciting and strategic game that can provide hours of fun for players of all ages. The project was realized using the Unity game engine in a relaxed atmosphere with relaxing music. The game allows for both playing with bots and multiplayer mode on one device. This was my first project where I was responsible for coding the main game mechanics and managing the project as the lead programmer, conducting code reviews, and guiding junior colleagues into the world of programming. I was also involved in releasing new versions of the game.
