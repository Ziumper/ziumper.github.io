# Project Description

The aim of the project was to create a real-time simulation of a reputation and trust-building scheme, offering valuable insights into the complexities of human interactions and digital ecosystems. The simulation provided data on the dynamics of trust and reputation building. I developed data analysis tools that allowed users to visualize trends, patterns, and correlations within the simulated ecosystem. This feature facilitated a deeper understanding of the factors influencing trust. The project was completed during my master's studies at the Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology.

## Functionalities

Application have following functionalities:

- a login window that allows tracking, filtering, and better understanding of the trust-building process stages in the simulation
- the ability to edit input parameters such as initial trust level, number of agents, or number of inputs
- boost mode, allowing for faster computation and simulation execution
- export of simulation results to an MS Office Excel file
- real-time preview of simulation results
- simulation status bar

## Technologies Used

In the course of the project, I became acquainted with the following technologies and tools:

- C++
- ImGui
- ImPlot
- GoogleTests
